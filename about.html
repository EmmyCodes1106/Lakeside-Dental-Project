      <h2>Dental Services at Lakeside Dental</h2>
      <p>
        At Lakeside Dental, we offer a wide variety of dental services to meet
        your oral health care requirements in one convenient location.
      </p>
      <h3>Regular Check-Ups and Professional Cleaning</h3>
      <p>
        At Lakeside Dental, we firmly believe that the best dental care is
        preventative dental care. Our goal is to help you maintain an effective
        routine for oral hygiene so that you are able to prevent tooth decay and
        avoid the cost and effort of dealing with cavities and gum disease. You
        can safeguard your smile with a visit every six months for a
        professional cleaning and dental exam. The dental team here at Lakeside
        Dental can remove stubborn plaque and tartar buildup that regular
        brushing simply can't handle as well as identify the warning signs of
        decay and damage that would normally go unnoticed.
      </p>
      <h3>Corrective Orthodontic Dentistry</h3>
      <p>
        You may be unhappy about the spacing or misalignment of your teeth, but
        you would like to know more about the options available. We encourage
        you to call us at
        <a style="text-decoration: underline" href="#">205-343-9393</a>
        and talk to our friendly, highly trained staff about our corrective
        dental procedures such as Invisalign® aligners. Invisalign treatment is
        a wonderful option for working adults because it produces similar
        results to traditional metal braces, but utilizes a series of
        custom-made, clear aligners that are virtually invisible. You are able
        to maintain your professional appearance and enjoy the dramatic
        improvement of properly aligned teeth without feeling self-conscious.
        Make Lakeside Dental your home for Invisalign clear aligners in
        Tuscaloosa!
      </p>

        problems can always occur. Whether the cause is physical trauma or
        untreated decay, our team here at Lakeside Dental will work with you to
        find the dental treatment option that is perfectly suited to your
        individual oral health needs.
      </p>

      <h3>Innovative Dental Care Technology</h3>
      <p>
        Here at Lakeside Dental, we utilize the most advanced, up-to-date
        technology in order to diagnose and treat dental problems with the
        highest level of accuracy and effectiveness. You no longer have to deal
        with time-consuming, traditional dental x-rays. Instead, we use
        non-invasive, painless equipment to instantly produce high-resolution
        dental images that allow our dentist to identify problems such as tooth
        decay, worn enamel, gum disease, or micro-fractures that would normally
        remain undetectable and untreated.
